Part B word_count.py   

Put the document "tweets.txt" and "word_count.py" under the same folder, and run the .py file in the terminal in python3 after changing directory to that folder.

You have to type in "--word 'xxx'", input the word or phrases you would like to search in the quotation marks to get the result of count.

If you do not type in anything, it will jump out a sentence to remind you of that! Here are some examples of commands you can try:

python3 word_count.py

python3 word_count.py --word 'we'

python3 word_count.py --word 'we are'
