Put the document "tweets.txt" and "word_count.py" under the same folder, and run the .py file in the terminal after changing directory to that folder.

You have to type in '--word "xxx"', input the word or phrases you would like to search in the double quotation marks to get the result of count.

If you do not type in anything, it will jump out a sentence to remind you of that! Here are some example of commands you can try:

python word_count.py

python word_count.py --word "we"

python word_count.py --word "we are"
